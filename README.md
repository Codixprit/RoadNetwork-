# RoadNetwork-
1. *Add Junction*: Adds a new junction to the network.

2. *Add Road*: Establishes a connection between two junctions with a specified distance.

3. *Shortest Route*: Finds the shortest route between two junctions using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

4. *Display Network*: Displays the entire road network.

5. *Exit*: Exits the application.



Why I made this application

1. Understand graph implementation in Java.

2. Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest route calculation.

3. Develop problem-solving skills using graph-based data structures.

How it contributes

1. Educational value: Demonstrates graph usage and Dijkstra’s algorithm.

2. Practical application: Provides a simple route-finding tool.

3. Community benefit: Offers a starting point for more complex network analysis projects.
